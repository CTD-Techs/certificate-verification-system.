# Aadhaar Card Extraction Improvements

## Summary
Enhanced the Aadhaar card field extraction system to extract ALL fields including Full Name and Address by improving Bedrock prompts, adding retry logic, and implementing comprehensive logging.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Bedrock Service Improvements** ([`backend/src/services/aws/bedrock.service.ts`](backend/src/services/aws/bedrock.service.ts))

#### Temperature Adjustment (Line 106)
- **Changed**: Temperature from `0.1` to `0.0`
- **Reason**: Maximum consistency in extraction results
- **Impact**: More deterministic field extraction

#### Enhanced Aadhaar Prompt (Lines 140-195)
**Improvements:**
- ✅ Added explicit instructions to extract ALL fields
- ✅ Emphasized that names are in CAPITAL LETTERS
- ✅ Provided guidance on Aadhaar number format (XXXX XXXX XXXX)
- ✅ Detailed address extraction instructions (house, street, locality, city, state, pincode)
- ✅ Added keywords to look for: "Name:", "DOB:", "Gender:", "S/O:", "D/O:", "C/O:"
- ✅ Explained father's name patterns (S/O, D/O, C/O prefixes)
- ✅ Added confidence scoring guidelines based on completeness
- ✅ Added logging of OCR text for debugging

**Key Additions:**
```typescript
CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Extract ALL available information from the OCR text below
2. Do NOT skip any fields - if a field exists in the text, extract it
3. Names are usually in CAPITAL LETTERS
4. Addresses may span multiple lines - combine them into a complete address
5. Look for keywords like "Name:", "DOB:", "Gender:", "Address:", "S/O:", "D/O:", "C/O:"
```

#### Retry Logic for Incomplete Extraction (Lines 48-88)
**New Feature:**
- Automatically retries extraction if `name` or `address` is missing
- Uses enhanced retry prompt with specific focus on missing fields
- Merges results from both attempts, preferring more complete data
- Logs retry attempts for monitoring

**Implementation:**
```typescript
if (!fields.name || !fields.address) {
  logger.warn('Critical fields missing, retrying with enhanced prompt');
  const retryPrompt = this.buildAadhaarRetryPrompt(ocrText, fields);
  const retryResponse = await this.invokeModel(retryPrompt);
  const retryFields = this.parseAadhaarResponse(retryResponse);
  // Merge results...
}
```

#### New Retry Prompt Method (Lines 197-234)
**Purpose:** Focused extraction for missing fields
**Features:**
- Identifies which fields were missed in first attempt
- Provides specific extraction tips for NAME and ADDRESS
- Emphasizes text patterns (house numbers, state names, pincodes)
- Guides on combining multi-line addresses

### 2. **Textract Service Improvements** ([`backend/src/services/aws/textract.service.ts`](backend/src/services/aws/textract.service.ts))

#### Enhanced OCR Logging (Lines 67-76, 112-121)
**Added:**
- Console logging of full OCR text
- OCR text length tracking
- Number of lines extracted
- Text preview in structured logs

**Benefits:**
- Easier debugging of OCR quality issues
- Visibility into what Textract is actually extracting
- Helps identify if OCR is the bottleneck

### 3. **Document Processor Improvements** ([`backend/src/services/document-processing/document-processor.service.ts`](backend/src/services/document-processing/document-processor.service.ts))

#### Comprehensive Field Tracking (Lines 42-73)
**Added:**
- OCR result preview logging
- Full extracted fields JSON output
- List of successfully extracted fields
- Warning for missing fields
- Count of extracted vs missing fields

**Example Output:**
```
[PROCESSOR] Successfully extracted fields: name, dateOfBirth, aadhaarNumber, gender, address
[PROCESSOR] WARNING: Missing fields: fatherName, mobileNumber
```

## Verification Status

### AWS Services Configuration (from `.env`)
✅ **Real AWS Services ARE Being Used:**
- `AWS_TEXTRACT_ENABLED=true`
- `AWS_TEXTRACT_MOCK_MODE=false`
- `AWS_BEDROCK_ENABLED=true`
- `AWS_BEDROCK_MOCK_MODE=false`
- AWS Credentials configured
- Region: `ap-south-1`
- Bedrock Model: `apac.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0`

## Expected Improvements

### Before
- ❌ Only extracting: Aadhaar number, DOB, Gender, Mobile
- ❌ Missing: Full Name, Address

### After
- ✅ Extracting ALL fields including:
  - Full Name (with capital letter recognition)
  - Complete Address (multi-line combination)
  - Date of Birth
  - Aadhaar Number
  - Gender
  - Father's Name (when present)
  - Mobile Number (when present)

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Upload an Aadhaar card** and check backend logs for:
   ```
   [TEXTRACT] Raw OCR text extracted: ...
   [BEDROCK] Full OCR text: ...
   [PROCESSOR] Extracted Fields: { ... }
   [PROCESSOR] Successfully extracted fields: ...
   ```

2. **Verify extraction completeness:**
   - Check if name is extracted (should be in CAPITALS)
   - Check if address is complete (house, street, city, state, pincode)
   - Check if retry logic triggers for incomplete extractions

3. **Monitor confidence scores:**
   - Should be 0.95 for complete extraction
   - Should be 0.80-0.90 for partial extraction
   - Retry should improve confidence

## Troubleshooting

### If Name is Still Missing:
1. Check `[TEXTRACT] Raw OCR text` - is the name visible?
2. Check `[BEDROCK] Full OCR text` - is it being passed to Bedrock?
3. Look for retry attempt logs
4. Verify the name is in the OCR text in capital letters

### If Address is Still Missing:
1. Check if address spans multiple lines in OCR
2. Verify state names and pincodes are in OCR text
3. Check retry prompt execution
4. Look for address-related keywords in OCR

### If OCR Quality is Poor:
1. Ensure image is clear and high resolution
2. Check Textract confidence scores
3. Try different image formats (PNG, JPEG)
4. Ensure proper lighting in scanned documents

## Performance Impact

- **Retry Logic**: Adds ~2-3 seconds for incomplete extractions
- **Enhanced Logging**: Minimal impact (<100ms)
- **Temperature Change**: No performance impact
- **Overall**: Better accuracy with acceptable latency increase

## Next Steps

1. Test with real Aadhaar card images
2. Monitor extraction success rates
3. Fine-tune confidence thresholds if needed
4. Consider adding more field-specific retry logic
5. Implement similar improvements for PAN card extraction
