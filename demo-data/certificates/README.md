- `cbse-12th-verified.json` ‚ùå
- `university-degree-pending.json` ‚ùå
- `diploma-unverified.json` ‚ùå

## JSON Structure

‚ö†Ô∏è **See [`CORRECT_FORMAT_GUIDE.md`](CORRECT_FORMAT_GUIDE.md) for complete format documentation.**

### Quick Reference - Correct Structure:

```json
{
  "certificateType": "SCHOOL_CERTIFICATE",
  "issuerType": "CBSE",
  "studentName": "Student Name",
  "rollNumber": "123456",
  "examYear": "2023",
  "issueDate": "2023-06-20",
  "issuerName": "Issuing Authority",
  "school": {
    "name": "School Name",
    "code": "SCH001"
  },
  "subjects": [
    {
      "name": "Mathematics",
      "marks": 95,
      "maxMarks": 100,
      "grade": "A1"
    }
  ],
  "qrCode": "https://example.com/verify",
  "digitalSignature": "base64signature",
  "metadata": {
    // Additional data here
  }
}
```

**Key Points**:
- Use `qrCode` not `qrCodeData`
- `school` must be object with `name` and `code`
- `subjects` at root level, not in metadata
- `examYear` must be 4-digit string
- `issueDate` must be YYYY-MM-DD format
